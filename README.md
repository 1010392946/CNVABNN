# CNVABNN
A method for CNV detection using neural networks and the AdaBoost framework

# Platform 
The algorithm is written by MATLAB and runs in window environment

# Content
This project provides a training dataset and a test dataset.In the test data set, there are two parts of data, one is simulationData, the other is realData. In addition, training scripts for neural networks, as well as test scripts for both types of data, can also be found in the project.

# Output
The output of this algorithm is the precision and sensitivity of the CNV prediction. If you want to extract the location and type of variation, you need to modify the script to output the prediction results to a file.
